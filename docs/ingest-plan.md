# Ingest Plan

1. **Normalize categories** — map each spreadsheet to master categories.
2. **Brand import** — dedupe brand info (origin, ownership, warranty, BTC).
3. **Product import** — create entries with tags/attributes.
4. **Testimony** — for each product, optionally store external quotes (source link + text).
5. **Filters UI** — build initial filter component on site once data is seeded.
6. **Daily expansion** — add new brands/products from shared lists and scraped sources.
